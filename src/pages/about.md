## Hiya folks!

My name is Andy Delso! I am a software developer with a primary focus on quality assurance. Currently, I work for [Hyatt Hotels Corp.](https://hyatt.com) as a Software Development Engineer in Test on one of their mobile teams. My current projects include a data mocking framework written in Kotlin and appium based automation written in Groovy (Geb and Spock).

As of August 2019 I am a [Twitch.tv affiliate](https://twitch.tv/ddaypunk)! Lately I have been streaming games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order. I tend to enjoy playing games with people, but I enjoy chatting with folks while gaming as well. I primarily like games with interesting stories and compelling gameplay like The Last of Us, but I also enjoy team based FPS games like Overwatch.

Outside professional and streaming, I also enjoy: playing guitar (alt. rock, pop punk), sketching (pencil, pixels), reading (sci-fi, technical), miniature wargames (Malifaux, X-Wing) and doing fun things with my family (legos, boardgames, travel).

Skills:
* Languages: Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Groovy, Python
* Automation: Selenium, Appium, Junit, RestAssured, Geb, Spock
* Technologies: Docker, React.js, Node.js, libgdx
* Tools: IntelliJ, VSCode, Insomnia, Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android

Thanks to [Panr](https://radoslawkoziel.pl/), the author of this awesome Gatsby.js starter template!
