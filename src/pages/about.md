## Hiya folks!

My name is Andy Delso! I am a software developer with a primary focus on quality assurance. Most recently, I worked for [M1](https://m1.com) as a Staff Test Engineer building out their Android automated test infrastructure. Although recently, I was promoted to Mobile Engineer on the Android team! I have been working on said infrastructure using Espresso and Test Lab. I am eagerly looking forward to working more in the app itself!

As of 2022, I have left Twitter for the friendlier confines of Mastodon. Come follow me [here](https://androiddev.social/@andy)!

As of August 2019 I am a [Twitch.tv affiliate](https://twitch.tv/ddaypunk)! Lately I have been streaming games like Red Dead Online, Assasin's Creed: Valhalla, amongst others. I tend to enjoy playing games with people, but I enjoy chatting with folks while gaming as well. I primarily like games with interesting stories and compelling gameplay like The Last of Us, but I also enjoy team based FPS games like Overwatch.

Outside professional and streaming, I also enjoy: playing guitar (alt. rock, pop punk), sketching (pencil, pixels), reading (sci-fi, technical), miniature war-games (WarmaHordes, Malifaux, X-Wing) and doing fun things with my family (Legos, boardgames, travel).

Skills:
* Languages: Kotlin, Java, JavaScript,  Groovy, Python
* Automation: Espresso, Playwright, Selenium, Appium, JUnit, RestAssured, Wiremock, Geb, Spock
* Technologies: Docker, React.js, Node.js, libgdx
* Tools: Android Studio, IntelliJ, VSCode, Insomnia, Proxyman Git
* Operating Systems: Windows, Mac, Android,iOS, Linux
