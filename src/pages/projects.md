## Professional Projects - Hyatt Hotels Corporation

### Data Mocking

Uses [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org/) to provide mocked responses to our mobile app. Allows for easier testing of error states and such.

### Mobile automation

Contributions to our automation framework that uses [Geb](https://gebish.org/), [Spock](http://spockframework.org/), [Appium](https://appium.io/) and [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). All tests are written using [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) and run using [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/). All tests are setup in [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) using job dsl style.

## Personal Projects

### [Selenium Framework](https://github.com/ddaypunk/dupage)

A reusable [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) framework built using the newest version of Selenium at the time, SpringBoot, and [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) amongst other things. Uses component based page object model as described and improved upon in my [blog article](/selenium-component-model).

### [React Playground](https://github.com/ddaypunk/playground)

A very simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) based website with an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server backend. Intended to be used in testing above selenium project over using solutions in order to have better control over the selectors available in the front end implementation. I used `create-react-app` to set up the project and express serves the site.

### [Card Shuffle](https://github.com/ddaypunk/card-shuffle)

Simple object-oriented programming exercise using [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) for an interview I did a while ago that shuffles a common deck of playing cards.

### [Fragments of Palladium](https://github.com/BedfordWest/fragmentology)

A game developed by a team of folks from work using Java and the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library. Project lead was [Bedford West](https://github.com/BedfordWest). I personally worked on some pixel art and the programming for the controls. This was never completed, but restarted using Godot engine in 2020.
