### [Selenium Framework](https://github.com/ddaypunk06/dupage)

A reusable Selenium framework built using newest version of Selenium at the time, SpringBoot, and JUnit5 amongst other things. Uses component based page object model as described and improved upon in my [blog article](/selenium-component-model).

### [React Playground](https://github.com/ddaypunk06/playground)

A very simple React based website with an Express server backend. Intended to be used in testing above selenium project over using solutions in order to have better control over the selectors available in the front end implementation.

### [Card Shuffle](https://github.com/ddaypunk06/card-shuffle)

Simple object oriented programming exercise using Java for an interview I did a while ago that shuffles a common deck of playing cards.

### [Fragments of Palladium](https://github.com/BedfordWest/fragmentology)

A game developed by a team of folks from work using Java and the LibGDX library. Project lead was (Bedford West)[https://github.com/BedfordWest]. I personally worked on some of the pixel art and the programming for the controls. This was never completed.
