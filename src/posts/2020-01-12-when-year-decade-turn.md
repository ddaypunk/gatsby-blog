Many "last of 2019" posts have caught my eye, as have posts recapping the past decade via social media. The interesting part in all of this is that all of life is basically a series of beginnings and endings. Openings and closings. Starts and stops. Yet, we focus on this "new year" or "new decade" with such fervor. Maybe we should. Maybe we need these stops and starts to understand who we are and where we came from and how we can be better versions of ourselves. 

In retrospect, so much as happened in my own life in the past 5 years alone that it really it really astounds me how many changes we go through in our lives from year to year, decade to decade. It sometimes feels as though I am 50 instead of 35 when I focus on just these past 10 short years.

So, here are my highlights of the decade as we hurtle headlong into 2020:
* been married and divorced
* been parent to two wonderful little humans
* worked at 3 different companies (Trustwave, Sprout Social, Hyatt)
* travelled to multiple places for work (Seattle, Hawaii, Texas, Colorado)
* quit playing in a band (I miss it dearly)
* lost a parent and grandparent (I miss them dearly)
* been a parent to a family member
* met and proposed to a wonderful lady
* travelled multiple places with said lady in country
* loss of my fiancee's brother
* shopped for and bought two houses
* shopped for and bought two vehicles

## Professional Growth

My growth professionally this past year has been much more significant than in the past few years. I truly feel like I can call myself a software developer now. It was hard to say or believe that in myself the past few years. It has taken multiple persons I highly respect telling me that to finally have enough confidence to truly believe in.

I was quite proud to have published my [first technical blog article](/selenium-component-model) this year. The thoughts behind it show how much I have developed this past year as a technical leader at my previous employer. Although I thoroughly loved that company, I made the hard decision to leave in favor of the new opportunities another position would allow for. I've been at the new company for a month now, and with each passing week solidifies that it was the right decision to move on.

## Personal Growth

Growth in my personal life, has been highly linked to my professional growth this year. Specifically I've made a habit of not raising my voice to my children as much. The verdict is still out on wether this will have any effect on them or their attitudes in the long run, but I like to think it makes me feel like a better person.

## Watching my Children Grow

I am constantly amazed by the things my children can accomplish on their own. They both still know how to push my buttons, but I make a habit of trying to overlook that.

My daughter, now in 2nd grade, is already quite an artist. She is always sketching or reading (above her grade level). She reminds me of myself at her age. Shes smarter than she lets on but gets discouraged quickly sometimes when it comes to math. Its funny that tonight at dinner she was practicing math on her menu and writing out a googol. She made a comment that she likes math now.

My son, starting kingergarten this year, is already looking like he might be great with math and logic. I love building legos with him (we gained a ton this year) and just talking about things he is interested in. He shows some tendencies to sketch and read as well. Its a good feeling to find notes around the house he writes about me or his "half-mom". It warms the heart.

## Relationship Growth

I've been trying to make a habit out of being more understanding with my significant other in our day to day. We definitely mesh well, but there were a few instances in the past I've been trying to learn from. This includes going back to being more honest with myself and her, trying to recognize when I am getting defensive, and just being helpful.

## Growth Through Loss

Losing my grandfather this year was a painful ordeal. He has been like a father to me all these years and much like when my mother passed, I wished I had seen him more often in the past 10 years. I tend to distance myself from family. Seriously, I tend to prefer text messages to phone calls. I would rather people just ask to come over, than to specifically invite them. Its just who I am. Unfortunately I had little control over this. Previously, my grandparents moved to Nashville and until more recently, I haven't felt I was fiscally able to travel there for visits. I was happy to speak at his memorial service on the many memories I have, but I still miss him dearly. 

## Thanks for the Memories

I enjoyed getting to start learning [pixel art] and [game development] this year. It was quite an undertaking working on a project that is not work related but heavily related to one of my passions, gaming. Thank you so much to BW for helping me to understand things and allowing me to implement the game controls!

It took a while, but I am very thankful to have made affiliate status on Twitch.tv this past summer! A huge thanks to my close friends [Shay] and [Sax] for all the lurks and throwing my name out there. Thank you to [Snaps] for being an inspiration due to how you interact with your chat and present yourself outside of streams. I had a fantastic experience at this year's Twitch Chicago Meetup as well and look forward to attending TwitchCon 2020!

Travelling with my fiancee and my children has been great this year. In February, I was able to take my now fiancee with me to Hawaii for work. It was there that I proposed to her on the beach in Maui after hiding the ring for a week. I purchased the ring literally the day before we flew to Maui! We also did our first road trip vacation with the kids to Nashville. It was great for them to spend time with their Oma (great-grandma) and us for a week. Its still hard to do tourist things with them, but it was a good first attempt.

It has been interesting to look back over the past year and I feel like I could write novels about some of the above subjects. However, we don't have enough time for that in this post.

When taking the last decade into account, I am not sure that 2020 me would recognize 2009 me. I've changed so much in 10 years professionally and personally, I am a very different person. The events of the past decade, and even the past 35 years have shaped me into a somewhat solid person, but there is still room for improvement. There is always room for improvement right? Constant improvement sounds like a good thing.

Up next... 2020 goals!
