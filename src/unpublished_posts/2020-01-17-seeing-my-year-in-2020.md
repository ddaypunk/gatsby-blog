## Intro
mixture of personal and professional goals that are interrelated to one another at times
do I put a next decade twist on this in anyway?
Look in notion for specifics
Might need to split this into two posts

## Technical Knowledge
In order to be successful in my career currently and in the future, I need to expand my technical knowledge this year. I can no longer just rely on my working experience in Java and Selenium. In order to accomplish this goal, I am hoping to do a majority of the leg work during my professional day. 

### Languages
I have already started looking into 3 new programming languages as a result of working with Hyatt as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET). These include Groovy, Kotlin, and Swift. The best thing about these languages is that both Kotlin and Swift will allow me to apply each in multiple ways.

Groovy is the main language Hyatt has chosen to implement their shared test automation framework with. Thus it is the primary programming language goal I have in 2020. It is built on top of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which is a nice leg up as I've already worked in Java. Groovy is also meant to mimic Java syntax but be more concise and easy to work with. So far, it has been pretty easy to read and understand. I look forward to mastering it this year.

Kotlin, has been a language I've wanted to learn for a while now. I've had a copy of Kotlin in Action for a number of months already. It is also built on top of the JVM; however, it was never intended to mimic Java, so that might make things a bit more of a challenge. Kotlin is also the official language of the Android mobile operating system. In learning it to do my day-to-day work with Hyatt test automation, I can also apply it to assisting with our Android app eventually!

Swift, is the official language of the iOS app ecosystem. Currently, I am learning it to add accessibility identifiers into Hyatt's mobile app. This allows our test automation framework to do less work when locating elements we'd like it to interact with. The added bonus, is that in learning it, I can also hopefully assist our team with the app itself!

### Tools
I am also going to have to learn new tools and technologies outside of pure programming languages in 2020. Two of note are Docker and Kubernetes. I was able to start learning Docker at Sprout Social last year, but I desire to become more proficient with implementing tools that use it. Kubernetes is kind of the next step as you can use it to orchestrate Docker containers. Learning how to use those with Jenkins would allow me to be able to stand up my own test systems.

### Projects
It will be impossible to rely solely on professional day-to-day learning of the above languages and tools. I understand that I will need to spend some personal time in order to solidify skills I am learning while working. As such, I will need to think of a few projects to aid in learning:
* Use Kotlin with libgdx on a game POC (two birds with one stone)
* Take Swift course and maybe make an app
* Finish my mentorship webapp I started at Sprout Social, to keep up on js (side goal)

## Blogging
post a new article once a month
use this to talk about progress on my projects
improve features on blog:
* social share links
* improve about me
* use projects as a showcase page
* keep improving css

## Photography
new lens, new possibilities
work on getting better editing
keep posting to Instagram

## Music
Its been a long time and its something I should really get back into
Get kids more into it

## Streaming
Deciding if its worth my time to continue pursuing for gaming
Need to spend more time on variety and gain followers: pixel art, and programming

## Relationships
Be more present in general
Kids - allow them to explore activities
Keep better contact with family and friends

## Health
I know I need to exercise more
Knee issues
Eat healthier

## Finances
Carrying debt too long
Understanding stocks
Diversifying income

## Travel
Year is kinda planned:
India
New York/New Jersey
Disney

## Wedding
Is it here yet? Excited!
Planning is in motion again
