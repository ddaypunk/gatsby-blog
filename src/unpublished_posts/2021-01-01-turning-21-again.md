## Personal

### Hobbies

### Streaming

For 2021, I have decided to refocus on my original mindset for streaming. I am not really in it for the money or for fame. My original goal was to foster a community of positivity, which I have truly found in my streamer friends @ The Shax. It is a community run my my two streamer friends from college SaxTrain and ShayShayFace. Through them, I have met amazing people to aspire to be like in all my life's endeavors. 

Thus, I am going to stop focusing on how many subscriptions I have/don't have. Any I am fortunate to receive and eventually get paid, will just pay the way for the next game or contest I decide to run.
