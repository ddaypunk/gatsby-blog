Writing this like I have read in Atomic Habits...

> Find quote about quitting smoking vs not a smoker

## I am a father

> When my children are speaking, I will put down my phone or thing I am doing (if I can) and give them my full focus

My children mean the world to me. Most parents can identify with that sentiment I would think...

I will read to them as much as I can, encouraging great books like Eragon that they can learn new words from and explore their imagination.

As stated in my last post, I feel like I don't get to spend enough time with them even with the increase in time available during quarantine. I know I am spending more, but it doesn't feel like it at times.

Using this focus, I will play more, draw/color more, teach more, and sing more with them.
## I am a husband

> When I lay down in bed, I will tell my wife I love her

I know I say it, but this just seems like a good habit to improve upon. I've been married 3 months, and it is going well so far all things considered.

I will say it more outside of the bedroom as well, as that is just as important.

> When we watch a movie or show, once a month it should be a movie in Hindi

Just before the end of the year, I came up with the notion that I know very little Hindi and I am married to an woman of Indian heritage. I tried the Duolingo route, but it was very confusing when they tried to show the alphabet/sounds portion. So I lost interest very fast.

My wife mentioned she learned through watching Hindi/Bollywood movies.

I will watch movies in Hindi with her, and attempt to learn that way.
## I am a developer

> On workdays, When I finish lunch, I will read something about programming

This year more than ever, I want to improve as a programmer. I have had a full year as a developer (in title) and it was great!

Primarily, I will improve not with any particular language but with how I code in general. As such, I will finish reading *Clean Code* as my first technical book of 2021. Already I am learning a ton from "Uncle" Bob Martin. Time to put it to good use after vacation!

Related to the above, I will be better about reading articles I bookmark to read later. My Pocket is way too full and Firefox tabs are getting overwhelming on my phone...

I will continue working on the "Fragments" game we started probably 3 - 4 years ago.

Regarding programming languages, I will focus on the ones I am using instead of looking into others like Rust. This means I will focus on JVM (Kotlin mostly) and JavaScript (mostly Next).

## I am a reader

> When I tell my wife I love her before bed, I will pick up a book to read to calm my mind

This year I will hit my reading goal on Goodreads of 20 books, utilizing books of various types (novels, comics, technical books, etc)

I've found that reading after chilling to some TV or streaming is a great way to calm my mind and tire my eyes.

I will finish books like Atomic Habits, Clean Code, and try to keep up with new Star Wars releases.


## I am an artist

> On Tuesday's at 8pm I will do something artistic for at least an hour

Art is something that has always been a part of my life wether it be drawing, writing, painting or music.

This year Tuesday nights will be my creative night at a minimum for 1 - 2 hours.

Things I am looking to do:
* Continue working on pixel art for "Fragments" game
* Paint my backlog of Hordes and Malifaux miniatures
* Utilize coloring books more often and use those nice colored pencils I bought a few years back
* Continue to pick up my guitar whenever inspiration hits
* Continue planning a roleplaying campaign as I read source material
* Write one blog article a month, be they personal, technical, review, or thoughts

## I am a streamer

> When I stream on Twitch, I will stop looking at my viewer count

This year, I am going to stop focusing on how many viewers I have. It seems like an unhealthy goal to have. 

I am not into streaming for the money other than to possibly purchase another game to stream or to giveaway.

I will promote positivity on my stream.

I will continue to value the many friends I have made through streaming. Thankyou SaxTrain and ShayShayFace for your continued mentorship and friendship.

# I am an athlete

> After the kids go to bed, I will do some sort of physical activity

This year more than ever I need to get into this mindset. I am fairly concerned about my cardiovascular and digestive health. 

There are multiple things I could do at home from Apple's fitness subscription to even Just Dance on my Switch.

Other alternatives to consider are a stationary bike or the Switch Fit related game...

Making it a general habit could have cascading positive effects on my life.

I will play more tennis when the weather permits, and introduce the sport to my children.
